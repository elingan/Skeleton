This is a sass version of skeleton that includes:
* normalize.css

## Installation
Npm
```
$ npm install scss-skeleton
```

Git
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bigmassa/skeleton.git
```

# Usage
The usage of this is generally for my own personal use.

I usually clone it to an existing / new project.
The folder `modules` is for custom css and any new files are imported into `_import.scss`.

Then finally run:
```
$ gulp watch
```
