## Usage
The usage of this is generally for my own personal use.

I usually clone it to an existing / new project.
The folder `module` is for custom css and any new files are imported into `_import.scss`.

Then finally run:
```
$ gulp watch
```

## Styleguide
Included is `styleguide.html` which contains most of the common html elements
